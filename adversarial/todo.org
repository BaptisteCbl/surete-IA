* DONE Code organisation [3/3]
# - [ ] Multiple precision without if/else (preprocessor?)
- [X] Regroup the code, use same models/data
- [X] Change model forward (Flatten)
# - [ ] Factorize code + separate into functions
- [X] Add logging for all training codes

* DONE Training [5/5]
- [X] Define stopping criterion:
 # - Epochs | Execution time | Accuracy | other ?
- [X] Normalize training data ?
- [X] Choose a model:
 # - depth | number of parameters | ...
- [X] Base training:
#  - MNIST, FashionMNIST + CIFAR10 ?
- [X] Adversarial training:
  - [X] Basic loop (FGSM +? PGD)
  - [X] Fast FGSM+PGD+FREE but hyperparameter tuning needed before to have some convergence
  - [X] Fast gradAlign None+FGSM+PGD+other?

* DONE Benchmarks [2/2]
- [X] Gradient-based [3/3]
  - [X] FGSM
  - [X] PGD
  - [X] C&W
- [X] Gradient-free
  - [X] SPSA
  - [X] HSJA
  - [X] Deepfool
-

* DONE metrics [2/2]
- [X] Plot training loss/accuracy
- [X] Accuracy against attacks (cf Benchmarks)

* IDEA
- Computing budget similar for training/attack (do not test a 15min attack on a image
  when the whole training took 15min)
