* STRT Code organisation [3/3]
# - [ ] Multiple precision without if/else (preprocessor?)
- [X] Regroup the code, use same models/data
- [X] Change model forward (Flatten)
# - [ ] Factorize code + separate into functions
- [X] Add logging for all training codes

* TODO Training [1/5]
- [X] Define stopping criterion:
  - Epochs | Execution time | Accuracy | other ?
- [ ] Normalize training data ?
- [ ] Choose a model:
  - depth | number of parameters | ...
- [ ] Base training:
  - MNIST, FashionMNIST + CIFAR10 ?
- [ ] Adversarial training:
  - [ ] Basic loop (FGSM +? PGD)
  - [ ] Fast FGSM+PGD+FREE but hyperparameter tuning needed before
    to have some convergence
  - [ ] Fast gradAlign None+FGSM+PGD+other?

* TODO Benchmarks [0/2]
- [ ] Gradient-based [0/3]
  - [ ] FGSM
  - [ ] PGD
  - [ ] C&W
- [ ] Gradient-free
  - [ ] SPSA
  - [ ] HSJA
  - [ ] Deepfool
-

* TODO metrics [0/1]
- [ ] Plot training loss/accuracy
- [ ] Accuracy against attacks (cf Benchmarks)

* IDEA
- Computing budget similar for training/attack (do not test a 15min attack on a image
  when the whole training took 15min)
